# Manual Test: Autocomplete Re-triggering Fix

## Test Steps

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application** at http://localhost:3000

3. **Test the autocomplete behavior:**
   - Start typing "Ciudad" in the location input
   - Wait for autocomplete suggestions to appear
   - Click on one of the suggestions (e.g., "Ciudad de MÃ©xico")
   - **Expected:** The input should be filled with the selected location and the suggestions should disappear
   - **Fixed:** The suggestions should NOT reappear after selection

4. **Test with keyboard navigation:**
   - Clear the input
   - Type "Guad" 
   - Use arrow keys to navigate to a suggestion
   - Press Enter to select
   - **Expected:** Same as above - no re-triggering of suggestions

5. **Test with geolocation:**
   - Click the location (crosshair) button
   - Allow location access if prompted
   - **Expected:** Location is filled and no autocomplete suggestions appear

## What was fixed

The component was re-fetching predictions every time the value changed, even when the change came from selecting a prediction. We added a `wasSelectedRef` flag to track when a value change comes from a selection (prediction click, Enter key, or geolocation) and skip the prediction fetch in those cases.

## Code changes

1. Added `wasSelectedRef` to track selection state
2. Modified the useEffect to check this flag before fetching predictions
3. Set the flag in `handlePredictionClick` and geolocation handlers
4. The flag is automatically cleared after being checked
